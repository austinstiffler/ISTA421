1. A *delegate* is a reference to a method, or a type.

1. Use the delegate keyword then specify the return type, a name for the delegate, and any parameters.

1. Write the keyword *new* followed by the name of the delegate, followed by the argument between parentheses.

1. Use the same syntax as you would to call a normal method.

1. *Events* are used to define and trap significant actions and arrange for a delegate to be called to handle the situation. Simply put, they cause something to happen in the program.

1. Prefix the declaration with the *event* keyword, then declare the type name, followed by the event name.

1. Subscribe by using the += operator. Unsubscribe by using the -= operator.

1. Raise an event by calling it like a method.

1. When an event fires and that event has been attached to a delegate, methods assigned to that delegate will be invoked.
